      "summary": "Vancouver, BC - Designed, built, and maintained a B2B software application that integrated elements of EA's enterprise systems with a remote corporate-partner system. More specifically, this J2EE “middle-ware” application integrated with 1) a MySQL database, 2) a “Tibco” JMS messaging system, 3) a remote application via HTTP/REST protocols, and 4) accessed the remote third-party application via HTTP/SOAP protocols (co-developed by myself and third-party development team) over a secure VPN. The business purpose of this project was to marshal, process and proxy EA customer data (i.e. online gamer data) to the remote third-party partner, thus creating the B2B relationship. The application had to support a high volume of real-time incoming data, which meant it had to be designed with high performance and reliability in mind. This application's core architecture relied on Spring, integrating separately designed software modules, built and packaged using the 'Maven' build tool. This greatly simplified and sped up development time. Other key technologies employed were Hibernate (for MySQL database access), JMX MBeans (for remote jconsole management), Adobe Flex (for rich administrative user interface), Axis2 (for SOAP communications), Apache- commons 'httpclient' api (for REST integration), Apache's 'xmlbeans' api (for xml processing) and a variety of other Java api's. This project's development methodology could be best described as a “loosely agile” in nature.",
